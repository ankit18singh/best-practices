# Explore your IDE
Most of the modern-day IDE’s like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA etc provides a lot of cool yet helpful features which we generally miss/avoid because we never tried to explore something new.

## Using Code Snippets
Suppose we need to create a service or a helper class to hold certain methods, and we need to do that very frequently and all of them follows a similar pattern. Hence you need to keep on writing everything again and again.
Also, we can rely on the framework’s CLI to generate those taking Angular 8 as an example if you follow a custom project structure.
In these cases, we can make use of code snippets either as a plugin or writing one of our own and you can even publish it for others too.
Follow this to [create your custom code snippets using VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) if you haven’t don't it yet.

## Using Shortcuts
Do you still use a cursor and mouse clicks to search a file in your project directory? Or do you still need to use a new terminal window to enter commands and to use git related operations? If it is yes, then you can easily avoid this old school habit now. Almost all the IDEs provide a set of shortcuts for you to save your time to perform those operations, in fact, you can create your own key combinations as well.
Some IDEs like IntelliJ provides us with the option to import shortcuts from other IDEs so that you can use utilise the power of their product with the shortcuts of your preference and get hands-on with the IDE. Isn’t that amazing?

## Using Linters & Formatters
When you are working in a team there is a big chance that you and your peer follow a different standard this can happen mostly because of the previous work or technology we have followed. In the software world, you cannot rely on just only technology need to be flexible enough to pick and grasp any new technology at any point in time. So if your hypothetical team has one member with prior Java experience and one with Python expertise clubbed together to develop software with NodeJS (that escalated quickly). This won’t affect the code’s performance but the standard which both the devs follow can make your code look very inconsistent.
And here code linter and formatter can help you standardise your code quality and make sure all the best practices are followed even after you are no longer working on that codebase.
[ESHint](https://eslint.org/) & [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) are some of the famous linters, which you can configure easily and it also allows you to [create your own rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/).
Similarly, you can [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code written in VSC.
