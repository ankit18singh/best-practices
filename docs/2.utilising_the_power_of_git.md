# Utilising the Power of Git
Git is vast and mighty. I am specifically mentioning Git here, knowing the fact that the majority of the developers uses git as their primary version control system. But if you are using something else then also you can follow these guidelines to maintain your code in a better way.

## Proper commit messages
Most of the devs take commit message for granted. But think of a situation where you need to create changelogs for a particular release and we all know how painful it is to create such notes with a disturbed commit history or untagged codebase. Hence we should keep a note that every code that is pushed to your VCS has a proper and user-friendly message and every release is tagged.

## Keeping release branch separate
This is a very debatable subject but to make sure only tested and working code goes live we should maintain a separate release branch and avoid pushing codes directly to it, no matter if it hurts your ego.
Make sure your local branches are in sync with the remote ones
In most of the cases, two or even more developers are using a specific branch while developing certain features, but we often forget to sync the local branch with the remote one which leads to codes getting overridden.
Hence we need to keep it in our practice to sync our local branch with the remote ones.

## Merge, Pull, Rebase or Cherry pick?
Guys this is the best time to improve our command on git system, [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) provides a very interactive doc to cover this topic if you are still not used to it then you should read a little more about it. Again, this will help you maintain and keep your git history clean.

## READ YOUR PEERS CODE
The best way to get learn some new things while working on a project and stay up to date of your project is to make sure you read your peers code whenever you get some time so even if they in their unavailability you can take the charge to continue on his work. Also learn to accept and take review comments in a positive way if it is made to improve your code. There is no shame in learning anything new.
