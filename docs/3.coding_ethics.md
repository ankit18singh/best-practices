# Coding Ethics
Again the way of writing a piece of code can vary from one person to another, but what matters the most is your code should be not only machine-friendly but also user friendly. Following are few points which can be used to make your code user friendly.

## Adding Docs and Comments
Writing a piece of code is not a big thing, to be honest, but if your code is not easily readable, people will avoid using it and it will be of no use at the end. We need to keep this mind that our code needs to be reusable and extensible enough to be easily used by other developers in future.
Documenting your code is essential to make it easier for other devs to understand your work quickly and save time.
If your code involved some research, or if you have taken reference from some online forum like StackOverflow etc, then attach the link of that paper, solution as well in the doc/comment, that way you can make sure it will be made available to everyone and they’ll get to learn something new.

## Writing test cases
Yes, I know. Why should you “A Developer” should do something for which your employer had hired a tester. So let me clear your thoughts about why unit tests are important and should be written by a developer.
Suppose you need to have a tightly coupled code, and you need to introduce an update or maybe a new feature in one of them.
How can you make sure that the one single change which you did won’t affect other modules? Especially for those days when we need to keep pushing frequent changes.
We have serval libraries available for almost the programming languages which can be used to write code level test cases which can again be either unit, integration or functional.
Some good testing frameworks which I have used includes JUnit, Mockito, Spock for Java/Groovy and Jest, Enzyme for Frontend.

## Prefer adding migration scripts to update your database
No matter how small an issue is, if it requires a change in the database, do not do it manually. Always make sure changes in the DB has been made only using migration script so that in future you can trace down when a particular change was done, and also if a script fails, then the fallback script should automatically rollback the changes.

## Follow official coding standards made available by the creators or use third party code, and make sure your code is DRY, and Maintainable.
