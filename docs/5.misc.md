# Miscellaneous
These are some add-ons from my end, which are again optional but can be handy at certain times.

## Automate your repetitive work as much as you can
We do need to follow a set of rules which are often repetitive, and time taking if performed one by one. Also, a huge chance of missing out a step can cause an issue. One of the best example we can take at this moment is the deployment and release process. No matter if we are managing our own servers or using modern-day serverless techniques, deployment and releasing needs to be done with proper care no matter how many times you have done it in the past.
If you have knowledge of any scripting language you can easily write a script to do these tasks for you. I personally prefer writing a bash script to take care of my automation process. Some possible use-cases can be:
-  Deploying code to your server.
-  Taking database backups on a regular basis.
-  Generating a signed APK using your keystone file.
-  Updating your SSL certificates
-  Invalidating Cache at regular periods etc.

## Read documentations whenever you have time, and stay updated with the changelogs of the technology which you are using.
Technology keeps on updating, and new features keep on adding every now and then. If you are a Javascript/Typescript developer you are used to these frequent changes, follow their official docs and subscribe to newsletters which will help you keep updated.
